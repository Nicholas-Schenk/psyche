                        <p>As of today, there have been over 33.4 Million confirmed cases of the novel Coronavirus in the United States.
                        COVID-19 caused mass unemployment and social isolation, leading to widespread uncertainty and pessimism about the present and the future. 
                        Although the restrictions have now largely been lifted, the mental toll —whether it is in the past or continuing to this day— that this year-long pandemic has had on us is undeniable.
                        </p>
                      
                        <p>Psyche seeks to aid you in maintaining or improving your mental health by providing you with both mentally and physically stimulating challenges.
                        Through quarantine, we found that one of the biggest detriments to ours' and our peers' mental health was the stagnancy and repetitive nature of life under lock down.
                            This realization led to the idea of <em>Psyche: </em> a mobile app that provides customers with a variety of activities to keep them busy along with a reward system to encourage users to stay consistent.
                            Although the pandemic is largely over in the U.S. now, we feel that there is reason to believe that Psyche will continue to be helpful to many people. 
                            </p>
                            <p>The pandemic has caused many companies to realize that in-person work is not as necessary to productivity as they once thought. 
                            On the flip side, many workers have grown accustomed to life with working remotely and don't want to return to the office.
                            Due to this shift, we expect that even as more and more places re-open, a much larger percent of the population will work from home than they did prior.
                            Therefore, we feel that Psyche will be a useful tool to help people everywhere stay active and sharp in this new environment.

                            </p>
                            <p>Psyche will be available on the Google Play store soon and we have plans to eventually bring it to iOS as well. We hope that you'll try us out and see how much we can improve your psyche!</p>

                        <p>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Psyche started life as our entry into the Carnegie Mellon University COVID-19 Innovation Project where we attempted to develop a solution that could help get us and everyone else through the mental health challenges that COVID caused. What we came up with would eventually become <em>Psyche:</em> an app that provides you with fun challenges to help keep you active and keep your mind stimulated. We settled on this idea because our research for the project showed that a large number of college students, including ourselves, experienced a drop in motivation as well as feeling as though they lack control due to the circumstances surrounding the pandemic. We hope the Psyche can help people like you deal with and defeat these feelings!
